# Identifying-Medicinal-Plants
This project uses  GAN for data augmentation and CNN (Xception) for identifying medicinal plants. It generates accurate plant recognition and provides their medicinal properties, making it a useful tool for research and studies in plant-based medicine.
# The development and execution of the "Medical Identification Using Plants" project relied on a variety of modern tools and technologies. These enabled efficient data processing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

1. Programming Languages
Python: Used as the primary programming language due to its rich ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and image processing.

2. Libraries and Frameworks
TensorFlow: Used for building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant leaves.

Keras: High-level API integrated with TensorFlow for rapid prototyping of deep learning models.

NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

Pandas: Used for dataset manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Used for visualizing results, accuracy, and loss graphs during training.

OpenCV: Applied for image processing tasks such as grayscale conversion, resizing, and filtering.

Augmentor: For performing image data augmentation to enhance the dataset with transformed images.

3. Tools & Platforms
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment for writing and testing Python code.

Google Colab: A cloud-based platform used for model training, offering free GPU acceleration for faster performance.

Git & GitHub: For version control and collaborative development.

UCI Machine Learning Repository: Source of the Swedish Leaf Dataset used in the model.

4. Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for feature extraction and classification of plant leaves.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Used as a baseline model to compare performance with CNNs.
